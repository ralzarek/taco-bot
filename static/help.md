If you turn me on, I will record messages that mention you (@ username and @ everyone) in all the channels I am in and PM them to you when you ask for them. That way, you don't need to hunt through tons of channel history!

Commands:
**!taco on** : turn me on
**!taco off** : turn me off
**!taco me** : get your messages in a PM
