**taco-bot** is a simple message recording bot designed to help people who don't log in to Discord often. If a user asks it to, the bot will record any message that mentions the user (@username and @everyone) in each channel it is in. The bot will then PM any recorded messages to the user.

To add it to your server, click [here](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=173254140359737344&scope=bot&permissions=3072). It only requires permission to read and send messages.
